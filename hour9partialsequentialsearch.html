// Filename: searchseq.html
// Sequential serach for an item's description and price.
// (This assumes the arrays hav been filled elsewhere)

// This code would be part of a larger inventory program

// This program assumes that the variable named TotalNumber
//		contains the total number of items in the inventory
// 		and therefore, in the arrays as well.
// First, get the part number the user wants to look up
	searchPt = prompt("Waht is the number of the part you want to see?");
	foundPart = 0; // a flag to know if the part is found
	for (i = 0; i < TotalNumber; i++) 		// Look through all inventory items
	{
		if (partNo[i] = searchPt)
			}
				document.write("Part Number "+searchPt+"'s description is");
				document.write(desc[i]);
				document.write("Write a price of "+price[i]); 
				foundPart = 1; //Turn on the flag
				break; 	  // Quite the for loop once the # is found
				
			}
			
	}
	// Now check the found part flag to see whether we found the part
		if (foundPart==0)
	}
		document.write(""** Sorry, but that part is not in the inventory.");
